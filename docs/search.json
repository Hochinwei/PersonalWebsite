    "text": "This is a personal project to create a live analysis pipeline that will show descriptive analysis of daily LinkedIn games records between PM and CW.\nThis pipeline will serve to elucidate who is the better overall player in LinkedIn games (Tango, Zip, Pinpoint and Cross climb) to date; between players PM and CW. Beginning from April 29th till today, June 17, 2025, data will continually be updated manually in the raw .xlsx file and ran through the pipeline for analysis when rendered.\nIn addition to summarizing means, medians, standard deviations, and visualizing score distributions over time, this document also employs Bayesian independent‐samples t‐tests for each game type to quantify the strength of evidence for performance differences between PM and CW. In each case, Bayes factors (BF10) is computed along with prior and posterior distributions plotted to illustrate how observed data update our beliefs about any effect (see Note 1 below).\nThis document aims to describe, visualize, and evaluate, using both descriptive statistics and Bayesian hypothesis tests, to assess the differences in scores between the two players.\n# Libraries utilized\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(BayesFactor)\n\n# Load the data in\ndat &lt;- read_xlsx(\"LinkedIn_games_data.xlsx\")\nTo account for missing data (e.g., failure to complete Pinpoint guesses), “-” will be recoded into N.A. and listwise deletion will be conducted to remove the data for the day. Additionally, since the data is manually entered, it is recorded in wide format. The code below pivots the wide format into long format, which is simpler for analysis.\nShow the code\n# Convert \"-\" into NA and all columns into double\ndat &lt;- dat %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ na_if(., \"-\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.double)) \n\n# Change to long format\ndat_long &lt;- dat %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -date,\n    names_to = c(\"Player\", \"Game_type\"),\n    names_sep = \"_\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )"
