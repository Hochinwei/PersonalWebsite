    "section": "My Journey",
    "text": "My Journey\nBefore landing at Hull for my PhD, I completed a fully-funded Master’s of Social Research (MSc) at the same institution. My path into research began earlier, though, at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, where I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. During my time at NTU, I was honored as an NTU President Research Scholar for two consecutive years—a recognition tied to my work in the Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus (URECA) programme.\nThrough URECA, I had the opportunity to lead two independent, year-long research projects under the guidance of faculty mentors. Those experiences solidified my love for research—the thrill of asking questions no one has answered yet, the satisfaction of uncovering patterns in messy data, and the joy of contributing something new to our understanding of human behavior."

In each case, Bayes factors (BF10) is computed along with prior and posterior distributions plotted to illustrate how observed data update our beliefs about any effect (see Note 1 below).\nThis document aims to describe, visualize, and evaluate, using both descriptive statistics and Bayesian hypothesis tests, to assess the differences in scores between the two players.\n# Libraries utilized\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(BayesFactor)\n\n# Load the data in\ndat &lt;- read_xlsx(\"LinkedIn_games_data.xlsx\")\nTo account for missing data (e.g., failure to complete Pinpoint guesses), “-” will be recoded into N.A. and listwise deletion will be conducted to remove the data for the day.
