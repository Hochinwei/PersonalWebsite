::: {#hero-heading}

I am a PhD student at the University of Hull, UK. 

My research area broadly lies in understanding human behavior interacting with AI-technologies. More specifically, my PhD project focuses on misinformation from AI-Imagery, and how do we cognitively process AI-images differently than "Real" images. I have a more diverse list of topics I am interested in (e.g., Effects of AI-pornography, discussions around what is "real" or "fake" information etc. - Refer to my blog for more!)
