::: {#hero-heading}
Hello, I am *Chin Wei*.

I'm currently a MSc psychology researcher at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/), as part of the prestigious White Rose Doctoral Training Partnership [(WRDTP)](https://wrdtp.ac.uk/).

Before this, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where I was honoured the title NTU President Research Scholar for two consecutive years, thanks to my work in the Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus [(URECA)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-research-experience-on-campus-(ureca)) programme.

I had the opportunity to lead two independent, year-long research projects under the guidance of faculty mentors, solidifying my love for all things research.
