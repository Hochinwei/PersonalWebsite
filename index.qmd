Hello! I am *Chin Wei*.

I'm a PhD researcher in psychology at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/), fully funded as part of the White Rose Doctoral Training Partnership [(WRDTP)](https://wrdtp.ac.uk/).

I explore how our minds and behaviours evolve as we increasingly interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies — uncovering the cognitive, social and neurological mechanisms that are reshaped with collaboration with AI tools.

Learn more [about me](about.qmd), or read about some of my [opinions](blog.qmd) and [projects](projects.qmd)!
